# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview
The purpose of the project was to allow us to visually review the earthquakes and magnitute of the quakes around the world for the past 7 days. In addition, the tectonic plates were also included in the data and those with an earthquake magnitude greater than 6 were also identified using a different color.
